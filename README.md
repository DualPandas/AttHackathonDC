Sample: bluelist-twilio
===

The bluelist-twilio sample builds upon the bluelist-mobiledata sample to add Twilio text notifications with Cloud Code. 

This sample works with the Mobile Cloud, an application boilerplate that is available on [IBM Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net).  With this boilerplate, you can quickly incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications without relying on IT involvement. You can focus on building your mobile applications rather than the complexities of managing the back end infrastructure.

After you run the sample and add some items to the list, you can see your data is synchronized between multiple devices.  Updates to the grocery list will trigger Twilio text notifications to a device based on your Twilio setup.
